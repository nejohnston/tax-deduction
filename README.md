Selenium project to calculate employee taxes

To run on Chrome, ChromeDriver is a necessary extension that must be added to path.
[Selenium ChromeDriver Installation](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started)

Before downloading ChromeDriver, make sure of your Chrome's version

Before running the program, open the ChromeDriver in Downloads. Otherwise, there will be an error because Mac will not open the file due to it being a download off the internet.

Two things to do before running the program:

Add a default download path on Line 110

Add the path to the chromedriver on Line 117
